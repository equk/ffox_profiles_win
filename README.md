Firefox profiles with security presets & userchrome styles on windows

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide a way to create new firefox profiles with security & privacy settings already preset.

It also includes some style customizations using `userChrome.css`.

## Why Make This Script?

*Mozilla Firefox has a profile manager in windows but doesn't create shortcuts for each profile & expects users to use the profile launcher to select each time.*

This script creates profiles & shortcuts for each making it easier for users.

It also uses the same preset settings & userChrome styles for each.

## Usage

Clone or download this repo

Edit `ffox_profiles.ps1` & add profiles you require to the `profiles` array

Optionally you may also want to change the `profilepath` variable (default is $mydocs\ffox_profiles)

Run the script

*script creates shortcuts & opens folder so u can pin them*

Pin shortcuts to each profile to the start menu / taskbar
