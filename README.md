Firefox profiles with security presets & userchrome styles on windows

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide a way to create new firefox profiles with security & privacy settings already preset.

It also includes some style customizations using userChrome.css.

## Usage

Clone or download this repo

Edit `ffox_profiles.ps1` & add profiles you require to the profiles array

Run the script as an administrator

Pin shortcuts to each profile to the start menu / taskbar

## Features

- [x] Adwaita Folder Icon
- [x] Bookmark Bar Spacing
- [x] Disable Ugly `urlbar` Zoom (firefox >75)

With this script you can have a pinned shortcut on the start menu & the taskbar for each profile.
